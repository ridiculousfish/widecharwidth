widecharwidth is a Python script that outputs implementations of `wcwidth()`, by downloading and parsing the latest `UnicodeData.txt`, `EastAsianWidth.txt`, and `emoji-data.txt`. Currently it generates code for:

- C++
- JavaScript
- Python
- Rust
- Java

## C++ Usage

You may directly copy and use the included `widechar_width.h`.

This header contains a single public function `widechar_wcwidth()`. This returns either a positive width value (1 or 2), or a negative value such as `widechar_private_use`. Note that there are several possible negative return values, to distinguish among different scenarios.

If you aren't sure how to handle negative return values, try this table:

| return value             | width                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `widechar_nonprint`      | 0                                  |
| `widechar_combining`     | 0                                  |
| `widechar_ambiguous`     | 1                                  |
| `widechar_private_use`   | 1                                  |
| `widechar_unassigned`    | 0                                  |
| `widechar_non_character` | 0                                  |
| `widechar_widened_in_9`  | 2 (or maybe 1, renderer dependent) |

## JavaScript usage

The JS file `widechar_width.js` contains the function `widechar_wcwidth()`. This behaves the same as the C++ version.

## Python usage

`widechar_width.py` contains the function `wcwidth` that returns either an int or a member of the `Special` Enum.

The values are the same as the other implementations, so you can compare them as int, or you can use it as an enum.

`wcwidth` takes either a string consisting of exactly one codepoint or an int representing the codepoint (like you would get via `ord("f")`).

```python
from widechar_width import wcwidth, Special

width = wcwidth(c)
# wcwidth returns an int for normal codepoints with a specific width
if isinstance(width, int):
    return width
# and one of the "Special" values otherwise.
elif width == Special.ambiguous or width == Special.private_use:
    return 1
elif width == Special.widened_in_9:
    return 2
```

The generated script should work with python 3.5+.

## Rust usage

In Rust, use `widechar_width.rs` and match `WcWidth::from_char()`. Example:

```rust
match WcWidth::from_char(c) {
    WcWidth::One | WcWidth::Two => (), // width 1 or 2
    WcWidth::Combining => (),          // zero-width combiner
    WcWidth::NonPrint => (),           // non-printing
    ...
}
```

## Java usage

For Java 8+, file `widechar_width.java` contains the `WcWidth` class definition, which you can use as follows:

```java
int width = WcWidth.Type.of(codePoint).defaultWidth();
```

The default values are based on the recommendations in the table of the C++ above.
If you need a different width for some types, create your own wrapper method using something like:

```java
final WcWidth.Type type = WcWidth.Type.of(codePoint);
switch (type) {
    case WIDENED_IN_9: return 1;
    ...
    default: return type.defaultWidth();
}
```

## Limitations

widecharwidth tries to give a width according to [Unicode Standard Annex #11](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/). However, as that mentions:

> Note: The East_Asian_Width property is not intended for use by modern terminal emulators without appropriate tailoring on a case-by-case basis. Such terminal emulators need a way to resolve the halfwidth/fullwidth dichotomy that is necessary for such environments, but the East_Asian_Width property does not provide an off-the-shelf solution for all situations. The growing repertoire of the Unicode Standard has long exceeded the bounds of East Asian legacy character encodings, and terminal emulations often need to be customized to support edge cases and for changes in typographical behavior over time.

So, unfortunately, we are forced to make some decisions. widecharwidth tries to find a sensible interpretation that has wide compatibility across up-to-date terminals.

In addition, a wcwidth-style per-codepoint API is fundamentally limited when it comes to composing codepoints. You *can't*, in general, decide the width of a codepoint in isolation. widecharwidth tries to solve some simple cases, and terminals having typically incomplete unicode support make this tenable.

One example where special interpretation is necessary are korean Hangul. In Unicode, a Hangul syllable are also available in a decomposed form consisting of multiple codepoints - a leading consonant, a vowel and a trailing consonant. widecharwidth, like [glibc](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22074) assigns the latter two a width of 0. This results in the total width for a complete syllable adding up to the correct value, but if e.g. a vowel ever appeared in isolation it would be deemed to have a width of 0.

In addition some renderers have differing ideas of the width. If that is the case for you, you might want to override widecharwidth for specific codepoints.

For example, in C++:

```c++
    // We render U+1F6E1 (ðŸ›¡) with a width of 2,
    // but widechar_width says it has a width of 1 because Unicode classifies it as "neutral".
    //
    // So we simply decide the width ourselves
    if (wc == 0x1F6E1) return 2;

    int width = widechar_wcwidth(wc);

    switch (width) {
        // Some sensible defaults
        case widechar_nonprint:
        case widechar_combining:
        case widechar_unassigned:
        case widechar_non_character:
            return 0;
        case widechar_ambiguous:
        case widechar_private_use:
            return 1;
        case widechar_widened_in_9:
            // Our renderer supports Unicode 9
            return 2;
        default:
            // Use the width widechar_width gave us.
            return width;
    }
```
